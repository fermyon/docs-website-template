# Documentation website for Fermyon projects

This repository is a template for the documentation websites of Fermyon projects.
It is intended to serve as the starting point for all new Fermyon documentation
websites, and is a practical adaptation of [the Fermyon style guide](https://design.fermyon.dev/).

## Running locally with Spin

To build and run the Spin documentation website:

1. Install and configure [Spin](https://spin.fermyon.dev).

2. Run the following `npm` commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run spin
```

3. View documentation website at http://localhost:3000
